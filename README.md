### This responsibility is about surveying logic gates.

##### Below, I will present the survey objectives for the NOT gate; other gates follow a similar approach:
* Truth table

* CMOS Operating Principle

- When the input A = 1, the PMOS transistor turns off, and the NMOS transistor turns on → pulls the output to ground → Output Y = 0.

- When the input A = 0, the PMOS transistor turns on, and the NMOS transistor turns off → pulls the output to the supply voltage → Output Y = 1.

* Symbol
* Delay (transition time)
* Average power
* Connecting with CL, RL
* Connecting three NOT gates in series
###### Other logic gates will also be presented similarly.
